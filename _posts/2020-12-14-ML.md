This was a multi-label classification problem in which a glass sample is categorized predictively as one of six glass types provided its respective oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etcetera), and refractive index. Random Forests and Decision Tree machine learning algorithms were applied to the UCI Glass Identification Dataset to compare and contrast the two models performance through prediction accuracy.<br>
