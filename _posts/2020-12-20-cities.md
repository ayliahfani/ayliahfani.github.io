The significance of predictors of quality of life and liveability of a city, along with the relationship of liveability with a country’s human development index were investigated. The Human Development Index indicated a moderate linear relationship with a country’s liveability, while predictor importance could not be represented in a valuable manner. More robust nonlinear modelling is required to draw advantageous insight for both the importance of predictors and the influence of a country’s development.
