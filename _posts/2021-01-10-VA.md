Canada is one of the leading destinations for international migrants globally, typically allowing one per cent of its population yearly the right to live in Canada permanently. In 2011, Canada had a foreign-born population of approximately 6.8 million, accounting for 21%. This paper uses visual analytics approaches to derive trends and patterns in Canadian immigration from 1980 to 2010. Tools such as Python Libraries and Tableau were used to create Spatio-temporal and temporal visualisations of the evolution of immigration and the demographics of those arriving.
