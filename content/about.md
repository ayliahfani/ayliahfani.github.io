      <strong>Hey I'm Ayliah! </strong>  A Canadian materials engineer turned data scientist who hopped across the pond.

      I received a Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Materials Engineering at McMaster University, and am now working on my MSc in Data Science at City, University of London. I am extremely driven, tenacious, diligent and love a new challenge. I have developed problem-solving and critical thinking skills, having performed in-depth research work, conducted testing and applied analytical methods, with abilities for assimilating new ideas and information. I contribute to teams through a highly persistent approach to problem resolution and accountability for completing all assigned responsibilities.

      <strong> Why the switch? </strong> Engineering is research-intensive, so we were continually handling data, which was time-consuming.  I admit, there was not a project that went by where I would not think to myself, "there must be a more efficient means of handling the data properly." Materials science is primarily based on the interconnected relationships of a material's processing, structure, properties, and performance.  These relationships are not overly understood, and this is where data science would significantly contribute to the realm of engineering. Materials science is entirely dependent on data gathered on these relationships, allowing for insights and predictions, yet materials informatics is in its nascent stages. The amount of data generated from theoretical and experimental models has dramatically surpassed our ability to handle it all. With the use of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, we can analyse, evaluate, and enhance materials in smart and strategic ways to fully realise their capabilities and to discover next-generation materials.

Outside of school, you can find me wandering around London, museum and gallery hopping, and playing sports not involving hand-eye coordination.
